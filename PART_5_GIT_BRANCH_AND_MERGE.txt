#Merge Branch on GIT
Merge devided by 2 category:
- Fast Forward: Occurs when the branch we want to merge is directly connected to the main pathway (direct path).
    1. run 'git checkout master' to move to master branch
    2. run 'git branch' to check all branch
    3. run 'git merge lecture' to merge between master and lecture
    4. run 'git branch --merged' to make sure the lecture branch has been merged to master
    5. run 'git branch -d lecture' to delete the branch
- Three-way merge/merge commit: The condition where the branch we want to merge is not directly connected to the main pathway.
    1. run 'git checkout master' to move to master branch
    2. run 'git branch' to check all branch
    3. run 'git merge student' to merge between master and student
    4. run 'git branch --merged' to make sure the student branch has been merged to master
    5. run 'git branch -d student' to delete the branch
